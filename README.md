The images in the "faces" folder are for the person to be identified.
"gelen" folder is where the images will be uploaded
"telegram" this folder is where the telegram bot will take the pictures
The "find" folder is where the faces defined or not defined by the program will be written.

The "images.json" file in the find folder automatically saves the data of the definitions and thus allows 
images to be added to the website in a web compatible manner with React and JavaScript structure.
